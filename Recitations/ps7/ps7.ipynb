    "In data science, a popular technique called kNN, short for **k Nearest Neighbors**, is used to find the k vectors in a dataset that are most like a new vector. For instance, a vector (array) could be user's ratings (out of 5) on a set of 10 action movies on Netflix, like so:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now suppose you have a new user input of ratings on these movies, and you want to find out which k ratings in the collection are most like the new user's ratings, i.e. which are the k-nearest neighbors of the new user, ratings-wise. This can then be used to recommend to the new user which other movies they might like, based on the likes of the k-nearest neighbors. (This is called \"collaborative filtering\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function that will return k-nearest neighbors given a 2D ratings array,a parallel user id array (i-th entry in user id array is the user id for the i-th entry of ratings in the ratings array), a user ratings array, and a k value. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must use NumPy for all computation. Use the Euclidean distance between two vectors (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Higher_dimensions) as a measure of similarity/likeness. The smaller the distance, the more alike. \n",
